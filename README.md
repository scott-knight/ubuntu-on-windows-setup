# Installing Ubuntu on Windows 10

This content demonstrates how to setup Ubuntu on Windows 10, to semi-replicate a Mac terminal setup for developing Ruby on Rails (or any other code you would want to use).

### INFO
Below is the step-by-step guide on how to install all the bits needed to get an Ubuntu instance installed, setup and customized to a state where you can use a console session to write and push code. The details of each of the steps (and there precise order of install) are a little hazy as I went through this process over the course of a few days. Additionally, I didn't anticipate creating a step-by-step guide, but I found myself creating notes as a safety measure to recover from destroying my Windows 10 installation (which never happened) and/or my Ubuntu installation (which I did happen several times). That being said, this is the (fuzzy) list of things that need to be done in order to get things working:

1. [Install WSL2](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/install-wsl2.md)
2. [Install VSCode (if you want)](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/install-vscode.md)
3. [Install Windows Terminal](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/install-windows-terminal.md)
4. [Install oh-my-posh and required libraries](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/Install%20oh-my-posh-and-required-libraries.md)
5. [Install Ubuntu](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/install-ubuntu.md)
6. [Configure Windows Terminal](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/configure-windows-terminal.md)
7. [Configure Ubuntu](https://github.com/scott-knight/ubuntu-on-windows-setup/blob/main/configure-ubuntu.md)

Once you have completed steps 1-4, you shouldn't have to do them again. Once Windows Terminal is setup, you should be good for the lifetime of your Windows 10 install (pending needed updates if there are any).

You will need to repeat steps 5-7 if you decide to delete your current install of Ubuntu and reinstall it.
